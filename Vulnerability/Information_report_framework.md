# Information report framework

## Alerting Model

Our alerting model relies on the following criterias:
- vulnerabilities rated as **high** to **critical** (according to the CVSS v3 indicator) affecting the Top 20 most commonly targeted technologies 
- all vulnerabilities classified as **critical** (according to the CVSS v3 indicator) affecting the Top 10 most commonly used technologies (OS, web browsers, mobile devices, web servers and CMS) and those classified as **high only if they are exploited**
